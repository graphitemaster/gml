# GML

GML (graphitemaster's language) is a dynamically typed, higher-order
interpreted, embeddable programming language designed specifically for
Neothyne and Redroid.

## Features
The general idea was to provide a language with the least amount of
native primitives while also being flexible and ignoring user-defined
types. To acomplish this, GML supports only five types.

* Numbers
* Atoms
* Strings
* Arrays
* Tables

Functions in GML are first-class and support full closures. Mutable state
within closures is handled implicitly and does not require a list of
local state to *capture*.

Tables are just dictionaries except they behave like dynamic structures and
allow for pseudo-user-defined classes similar to how one would try to
write classes in Javascript or Lua.
